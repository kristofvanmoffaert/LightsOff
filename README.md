# LightsOff
In a project of ours, we were monitorring and controlling a household equipment such as printers and coffee makers. 
Whenever the device was turned off, this application could remotely initiate the system by sending information over sockets. 
Additionally, the user could identify itself and denote the level of discomfort he experienced. 
This way, we could monitor both the usage and the users of these household devices and analyse this information.
In a second part of the project, schedules for these devices are learned and updated based on reinforcement learning.

A screenshot of the simple user interface can be found below:
